After learning that an NLP task might be performed using CNN, I was fascinated. So, throughout the study, we will classify emails using CNN. The dataset includes roughly 18000 emails divided into 20 categories such as sports, health, religion, and so on. The network's core backbone is the 1D convolution neural network, which is used for classification.
