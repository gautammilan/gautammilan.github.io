<!-- ## Introduction -->
I used my Facebook conversations to train the RNN model. So the model will aim to mimic how I converse with people, only by providing the initial character for an input, say 'h,' will generate an entire message beginning with the character 'h,' such as "how are you doing today?". Because the model was trained on a single character, it may now be trained in any language.
