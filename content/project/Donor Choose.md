DonorsChoose is a United States-based nonprofit organization that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom projects. According to last year data around 500,000 proposals were sent by teachers all around the world to DonorsChoose hoping to get the donation for their respective projects. Organization goes through every single project proposal to select those proposals which have a higher probability of getting donations. After selecting the project Donor Choose organization will display the selected project on their website allowing the donor to go through the project which they are likely to donate. Here the main problem is going through all the project proposal equired a large number of resources and cost a tremendous amount of money.

# Objective

Model will produce an output for every single proposal, where output '1' indicates that the proposal has high chance of acceptance and '0' indicates the rejection probability
