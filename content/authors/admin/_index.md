I am from Nepal, where I have completed my bachelor's in computer engineering from [Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Paschimanchal Campus](https://www.ioepas.edu.np/). 

Currently, I am working at [palwa.ai](https://palua.ai/) as an AI engineer, where I developed the first ever state-of-the-art Nepali language model trained on a large dataset along with the Nep-gLUE benchmark. I am now working on active learning research for both computer vision and NLP problems to make the data annotation process faster, increase label efficency, and reduce the cost of annotation.
