Hello, my name is Milan Gautam, and I am an undergraduate computer engineering student at the Institute of Engineering Paschimanchal Campus. I've always been fascinated by computers and robots, and my curiosity was piqued after viewing the film Robot, in which a humanoid robot gains the ability to think like a person. After learning about artificial intelligence on YouTube and its limitless possibilities for connecting a computer with emotions, I know this is the path I want to go on with my career. Since then, I've worked on various projects and honed crucial skills ranging from data preparation to hyperparameter tuning.

Currently, I am working on a dream project of developing a cutting-edge language model in my native Nepali language.
