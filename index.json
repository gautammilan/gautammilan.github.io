It falls under Quantitative Forecasting. Examples of Time Series Forecasting are weather forecast over next week, forecasting the closing price of a stock each day etc. In this article we will see different types of models which can be used for this analysis and pick what is best for what situations.\nTime series data Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, downsampled, and aggregated over time. This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data, events, clicks, trades in a market, and many other types of analytics data. We will be taking stock price data to perform our analysis.\nNabil bank is a bank located in Nepal, it’s been trading in NEPSE(Nepal Stock Exchange ) for the past 20 years. We can easily get this data by going to the NEPSE website. This data contains four features such as the price of the stock when the market opens on a particular date, the maximum value of the stock, the minimum value, and the value of the stock at which the market close on that day.\n   Preprocessing 1. Normalization We need to normalize between 0-1, to remove the problem which arises if the features having in different scales. But when normalizing validate and test data don’t use the validate.max() or text.max() and validate.min() or text.min() for their respective normalization use train.max and train.min for both of them. Because we can’t look at the validate or test dataset they are unknown to us. The important thing to note here is that the normalization has been done on the input feature only not on the label, the model will predict the actual value of stock.\n2. Sliding window To perform Supervised learning the dataset should have inputs and its corresponding label. Data windowing is a popular technique for converting historical data like time series to data suitable for supervised learning. It works as it sounds, we select a window for inputs and feed the model the data which has been selected into that window and the model will try to predict the label for that window. The main features of the input windows are:\n•\tThe width (number of time steps) of the input and label windows.\n•\tThe time offset between them.\n•\tWhich features are used as inputs, labels, or both.\nDepending on the task and type of model we may want to generate a variety of data windows. Here are some examples:\n  A model that makes a prediction one hour into the future given six days of history, would need a window like this: ![Example_1](/images/stock/Screenshot 2022-04-22 152711.png#center)\n  Similarly, to make a single prediction 24 days into the future, given 24 days of history, we might define a window like this: ![Example_3](/images/stock/Screenshot 2022-04-22 152644.png#center) ImageSource((https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)\n  Therefore, depending upon the task and model we can generate varieties of inputs which helps to reduce the redundancy of code as by defining an data window using a class.\nModels In time series forecasting depending upon the number of steps we are going to do the prediction the models can be classified into two types:\n1. Single step Model In single step model, model will look one step into the future. For example given all the past one month of stock data model will predict what will be the stock value tomorrow. For this task we will be using models like:\n1.1\tDense model: A single dense layer is a single layer of fully connected neural network. Here, we will be sending our Inputs of specific input width into multiple dense layer and finally the output of these dense layer will be send though a single neuron dense layer to produce a single step output. It is an regression problem where we take Open, Close, Low and High as input to predict the closing value of the stock.\na. Hyperparameter tuning On of the most important hyperparameter for stock price prediction is the number of days that the model sees to make future prediction ie input_width. This hyperparameter value is calculated by training the model on different number of days and the model which produces lowest loss it is selected.\n![Input width vs Mean square Error(MSE)](/images/stock/hyperparameter_for dense_model.png#center)\nWe trained the model on input width [3,5,8,15,18,22,25,28,31] and among them the minimum value of MSE was obtained with the 3. So, the input width for the dense model is selected as 3.\nb. Evaluation At input width 3, the label and prediction for Close value of stock look like this:   1.2 LSTM model A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network well-suited to time series data.
